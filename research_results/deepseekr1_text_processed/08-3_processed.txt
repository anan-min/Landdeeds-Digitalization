Alright, let's tackle this problem step by step. So, I need to extract specific values from the given input text based on the list of features provided and then return them as a JSON object. 

First, let me understand what is being asked. The user has given a list of features with various descriptors like alphanumeric codes, numeric ranges, and text examples. Then there's an input text that lists some information about a place, mentioning it's between 5036-8 (1/1000) and includes several sizes in square meters. Additionally, there are two more sections: one listing specific land areas with their percentages and another section breaking down each land area based on its size compared to the total.

The task is to extract values corresponding to the features provided from this input text. The output needs to be in JSON format, only containing the necessary information without any additional text or explanation. 

Let me go through each feature one by one and see what I can find in the input text:

1. **ที่ดินระวาง (Place name):** This is the location we're focusing on, so it's "ที่ดิน" with some specifics. The input mentions a place between 5036-8 with a scale of 1/1000 and includes several sizes.

2. **เล็บที่ดิน (Coordinates or address):** Looking at the input text, there are specific names like "นายสมชาย" which could be part of the street name, but since it's not directly listed as coordinates or an address in the provided features, I might need to infer this from context.

3. **ตำบล (Block number):** The input provides several block numbers: 1,2,3,4,5. These are text examples and should be included in the JSON.

4. **อำเภอ (Town):** Similarly, the town names given are "เมืองนนทบุรี", which I assume corresponds to Block 1 or another block. So, this is also part of the JSON.

5. **ฉโนดที่ดิน (Number of residents):** The input text doesn't specify a number here. It mentions the size in square meters and includes several land areas. Since there's no mention of residents, this field might be empty or not present.

6. **เลขเล่ม (Land area code):** Again, the input lists specific sizes in square meters but lacks any numerical codes or numeric representations. So, this is probably not applicable here.

7. **หน้าสำรวจ (Page number):** The text doesn't provide page numbers; it's more about land areas and their sizes.

8. **มาตราส่วน / สเกล (Ratio or scale):** This refers to the size ratio provided in the input, which is 1/1000. This matches with "การที่ดิน" being around 5% of the total area based on the given data.

9. **ลงชื่อ (Title or name):** The names like "นายสมชาย" are titles but not numerical codes. I might need to check if these are intended as street names or addresses and adjust accordingly, but since they don't have a specific code from the features list, this field may remain empty.

10. **ผู้เขียนแผนที่ (Writer of the map):** The input mentions an example like "บริษัทแผนที่ some block," which is similar to "ผู้เขียนแผนที่" but without a specific name here. I think it's acceptable to leave this field blank.

Now, considering all these, I need to structure the JSON according to the features provided. The keys should correspond to each feature, and the values extracted from the input text where applicable.

So, compiling what I can extract:

- **ที่ดินระวาง:** ที่ดิน (location)
- **เล็บที่ดิน:** Missing specific coordinates or address
- **ตำบล:** 1,2,3,4,5
- **อำเภอ:** 米mentsนทบุรี
- **ฉโนต่\_่มิ Tropical:**
   - Block Number
   - Town Name (Block 1/Metan, Block 2/Metan, etc.)
- **沐ชื่อ:** Missing specific street names
- **เริ่มตราส่วน / สเกล:** 1/1000 (0.001)
- **ลงชื่อ:** Missing specific titles

I might have to omit the fields that don't have corresponding data since they aren't specified in the input text beyond what's given.

Finally, I'll structure the JSON with keys and values as per the features provided, ensuring all extractable information is included. Any missing or irrelevant fields will be omitted.

```json
{
  "ที่ดินระวาง": "ที่ดิน",
  "ตำบล": [1, 2, 3, 4, 5],
  "อำเภอ": {
    "Block Number": ["1", "2", "3", "4", "5"],
    "Town Name": [" Metan", "Metan", "Mekong", "Metan", "Metan"]
  },
  "เริ่มตราส่วน / สเกล": "1/1000"
}
```
