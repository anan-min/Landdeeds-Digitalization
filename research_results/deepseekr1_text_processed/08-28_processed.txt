Alright, I've got this task where I need to extract specific features from a given input text and convert them into a JSON object. Let me break down how I approached this.

First, I read through all the features provided. Each feature has a key like "ที่ดินระวาง" and values that describe what it is. My goal is to map each of these keys to their corresponding values in the input text.

Looking at the input text, there's a table with three columns: หน้า, มี, 和不上。The first column seems to represent page numbers from 1 to 42. Since all the entries are marked with ✓, it looks like every row represents a filled page on that section of the map.

I notice that each cell in the "มี" column is filled with a checkmark (✓). This indicates that there are no missing pages in this section of the map. It seems straightforward because all the pages are present, but I should double-check if any entry has an empty or blank cell. However, looking through each row, they're all checked, so I can confidently say every page is present.

Now, considering the other features: "เลขที่ดิน", which refers to alphanumeric codes. But in this text, there are no numbers at all; it's filled with checks and dots. So, "เลขที่ดิส" probably doesn't apply here because there are no numeric entries provided.

The feature "ตำบล" is for text descriptions, like street names. However, since the table has only a section labeled 1-37, I don't see any specific street names mentioned. Therefore, it's possible that this feature isn't applicable in this context without additional information.

Similarly, "อำเภอ" and "เมืองนนทบุรี" are also text-based features but again, the input text doesn't provide any textual descriptions or specific locations. So, these features aren't applicable either.

The feature "came ratio/ scale", which is a numeric range from 0-100, isn't present in the text at all. It's only introduced as an additional feature for more detailed information. Hence, it doesn't apply here.

"ลงชื่อ" and "ผู้เขียนแผนที่" are also not mentioned in the input text. They refer to image references or copyright information, which aren't present here.

Lastly, other features like "footnotes and annotations" don't seem relevant since we're only dealing with page numbers, filled sections, and visual descriptions without any additional metadata.

So, putting it all together, the only feature that makes sense in this context is "Newton 12/37", which likely refers to a specific section of the map. The rest are either absent or don't apply based on the provided text.
