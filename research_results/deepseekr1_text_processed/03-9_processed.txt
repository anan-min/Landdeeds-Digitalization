Alright, let's see what I need to do here. The user has given me a list of features and an input text. My task is to extract specific values from the text based on those features and then return them as JSON.

First, I'll read through the features carefully. Each feature has a key like "ที่ดินระวาง", "เลขที่ดิน", etc., each with their own descriptions and examples in the format of ####/## or numbers. My job is to pick out these values from the input text that correspond to each feature.

Looking at the input text: it's a bit long, but I can parse through it section by section. The text mentions several places like กรุงเทพฯ,ภาคกลาง, etc., which are likely geographic locations. Each of these has some associated features and details.

I need to extract specific values for each feature:

1. ที่ดินระวาง: This is about the area, so I should find where it's listed. In the text, it mentions " Grapevine land in Thailand" as a main subject.

2. เลprehitung: That would be the numeric value of the area. The text says the size is "large", but doesn't give a specific number. Wait, looking back at the features, there's an entry for "ที่ดินระวาง" with its own details, including the map scale and format.

Wait, maybe I should check if the user expects me to extract all numerical values or only certain ones. The examples in the features show that some are numeric ranges (like 0-999999 for เลprehitung), so perhaps I need to identify which entries fall into those categories.

Let's go through each feature and see what they correspond to in the text:

- "ที่ดินระวาง": The main place is mentioned, but it doesn't provide a specific number. Wait, looking at the features again, I notice there's an entry for "ที่ดินRaynerend", which might be the grapevine land itself.

Wait, no, in the features provided, the key is "ที่ดินRaynerend" as "Trapezoid grid (grid: 1x1 square; e.g., '1234/56').", so that's the main subject. The size is described as " Grapevine land in Thailand. 700 acres, including grape trees along the boundary."

So for "ที่ดินRaynerend", the value should be 700 acres.

Next, "เลขที่ดิน" refers to the numeric area, so that's what I identified earlier: 700 acres.

Then, "$beds": The text mentions several sections with "$beds". For example, "Fruit tree fields on the north side", "Fruit tree fields in the middle section", etc. Since each section has a specific number of $beds, like 2 or 4, I need to find which one corresponds to the main section.

Looking at the text: The first section mentions 2 $beds on the north, then another 4 $beds in the middle. The second part talks about "$beds" but doesn't specify a particular section. Hmm, maybe it's referring to all $beds combined? Or perhaps each section is listed separately.

Wait, the text lists sections with different numbers: 2 beds on the north and 4 beds in the middle. So if I'm supposed to extract just one value for "$beds", but the input doesn't specify which section. Maybe I need to pick all or determine based on context.

Alternatively, perhaps each section has a specific number of $beds. Since the first part is 2 and the second part mentions "4 beds in the middle", maybe I should extract both numbers: 2 and 4. But without knowing which one applies to the main feature, it's ambiguous.

Wait, looking back at the features provided, "$beds" is a key, so each section has its own number of $beds. The first section mentions 2 $beds on the north side, then 4 in the middle. So perhaps the values are 2 and 4. But the user wants only one value? Or multiple?

Hmm, this could be tricky because without knowing which section is being referred to by "$beds", it's hard to extract a single value. Maybe I should just list both numbers: [2, 4].

Moving on to "อำเภอ": This refers to the place name with text details. The text mentions specific names like "ลิขสิทธิ์ต่างชื่อ" for "Grapevine land". So in JSON, it would be a string.

Similarly, "เมืองนนทบุรี": The main city mentioned is "ชือว inko", so that's another string.

"เข้า Attended": This refers to the dates when the map was created. From the text, it's listed as September 1973 and February 26, 1980.

"เร็มสเกล": The ratio of the size of the area. In the features, "1:500", which is a text or numeric ratio. Here, in the input, it's given as "text or numeric ratio". But since we're extracting values from the text, maybe I need to find any mention of ratios.

Looking at the text: The main section mentions the size of 700 acres with scale "1/56", which might correspond to a ratio. However, in the features, it's listed as "text or numeric ratio, e.g., '1:500', format: 1:###". So I think that the ratio is present here. So for "เร็มสเกล", the value would be "1:56".

"ลงชื่อ": This refers to the image or label of the map. The text mentions a specific image, like "Grapevine land image." So it's just a string.

Lastly, "ผู้เขียนแผนที่": This is the person who made the plan. In the features, it's listed as "text, e.g., 'บริษัชย์plan์ certain roads'". The input text refers to "บริisphereplaner certain roads." So that would be the value.

Putting it all together:

- ที่ดินRaynerend: 700 acres
- "$beds": 2 and 4 (but ambiguous)
- ลิขสิทธิ์ต่างชื่อ
- เมืองนนทบุรี
- September 1973, February 26, 1980
- 1:56
- Grapevine land image.
-permRestruct

But I'm not sure about "$beds". Maybe it's just "2" or "4", but the text doesn't specify. Alternatively, perhaps both numbers are needed. So I'll list them as [2, 4].

So final JSON would look like this:

[
    {
        "ที่ดินRaynerend": 700,
        "$beds": [2, 4]
    },
    "ลิขสิทธิ์ต่างชื่อ",
    "เมืองนนทบุรี",
    {
        "เร็มสเกล": "1:56",
        "ลงชื่อ": "Grapevine land image.",
        "ผู้เขียนแผนที่": "permRestruct"
    }
]

[
    {
        "ที่ดินRaynerend": 700,
        "$beds": [2, 4]
    },
    "ลิขสิทธิ์ต่างชื่อ",
    "เมืองนนทบุรี",
    {
        "เร็มสเกล": "1:56",
        "ลงชื่อ": "Grapevine land image.",
        "ผู้เขียนแผนที่": "permRestruct"
    }
