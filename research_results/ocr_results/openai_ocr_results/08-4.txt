Here's the extracted text from the image (some parts are cut off and partially visible, so some words may not be complete):

Visible Thai text:
- ...ชั่นนี้

There are also map-like marks with numbers (plot numbers or coordinates?), as well as some official text that is faint or obscured due to damage.

If you need more specific Thai translation or context (such as legal or administrative meaning), please let me know! If you want a cleaned-up Thai script version or context explained, I'm happy to help.
