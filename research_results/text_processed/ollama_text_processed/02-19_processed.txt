Alright, I need to extract the corresponding values from the given input text based on the provided features and return them as a JSON object. Let me go through each feature one by one.

First, "ที่ดินระวาง" refers to alphanumeric code, with an example of '1234/56'. The input text mentions "มาตราส่วน 1:200", so I'll take that as the value for this key.

Next, "เลขที่ดิน" is numeric from 0-999999. The text has numbers like "1.8000" and "1000", but since we're dealing with numeric values, it's "1:200". I think the user intended for this to be a numeric value, so that should be 1:200.

Moving on to "ตำบล", which is text like 'บางขุนเทียน'. The input includes "รูปแผนที่" and "มาตราส่วน", but it doesn't mention any specific addresses. However, since the task is about extracting known features, I'll note that there's no "_editor" value here.

For "อำเภอ", which is also text like 'เมืองนนทบุรี'. The input contains "รูปแผนที่", so perhaps this key isn't applicable unless there's more specific information. Since we don't have an entry for "กติบัญ", I'll leave it as undefined.

"ฉโนดที่ดิน" is numeric from 0-999. The text mentions "1.8000" and "1000", which are within the range, so that's 1.8000.

"เลขเล่ม" is numeric from 0-99. There are numbers like "1000" here, so that's 1:200 since it's a ratio, but I need to check if it's a number. Wait, the text has "1:200", which is a ratio, not a number. So maybe this key isn't applicable unless there's a specific number provided.

"หน้าสำรวจ" is numeric from 0-100. The input includes "รูปแผนที่", so perhaps this isn't relevant here.

Lastly, "ผู้เขียนแผนที่" refers to text like 'บริsshกแผนที่uth Bernstein', but the input only mentions "รูป Planned" and "มาตราส่วน". Since there's no direct entry for "ผู้เขียน", I'll leave this as undefined unless more info is provided.

Putting it all together, I should have values for ที่ดินระวาง, เลขที่ดิน,bolded, Philippe,MEET, and me, but not for Edited, Leshu, and Nekon based on the given text.
