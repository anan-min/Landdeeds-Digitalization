Alright, let me tackle this problem step by step. I'm given a list of features and an input text that seems to be an excerpt from a document. My task is to extract the corresponding values from the input text using the provided features as keys in a JSON object.

First, I'll read through the features carefully to understand what each key represents. The features are labeled with descriptive names like "ที่ดินระวาง" which translates to location identifier, and each has associated information such as alphanumeric codes or numeric ranges.

Next, I look at the input text: "# เลขที่ดิน". It seems to be a fragment of the text that includes some additional information about the road number. The numbers are between [ ] in Chinese characters, so I'm guessing it's using a specific format for these numbers, maybe an alphanumeric code as per the first feature.

The input text also mentions "รายละเอียด" which is "details," followed by two bullet points: - ที่ดินระหว่าง... and - เลขที่ดิน.... The first part seems to be about the location in relation to a road, while the second part likely describes the numbers associated with the road number.

Looking at the features again, I need to find which ones match "ที่ดิน" (location) and the "เป็น" (are they) part when referring to the numerical values of the road. The first feature is about alphanumeric codes, but this text doesn't have any letters, so that might not be it. The second feature deals with numeric ranges for roads.

In the input text, I see numbers in Chinese within square brackets, which likely correspond to numeric values. The range is 0-999999, as per the "เลขที่ดิน" feature. Therefore, the corresponding value should be a string that represents this alphanumeric code or ratio from the first feature.

Putting it all together, I realize that "ที่ดิน" corresponds to the "Newton" feature with the range 0-999999. Since the input text uses Chinese numerical notation within brackets, the JSON value should match the format expected for a numeric range, which is likely "0-999999". However, looking back at the features, there's a specific note about the format: "E.g., '1234/56'". Wait, that might not fit here since the numbers are in square brackets. Maybe I'm misinterpreting something.

Alternatively, perhaps the text uses a different formatting method for alphanumeric codes. Since the input has numbers within [ ], it's likely using an alphanumeric identifier rather than numerical. Therefore, the corresponding value should be "0-999999" as per the numeric range feature.

After double-checking the features and understanding how they are formatted, I'm confident that this is the correct JSON structure.

```json
{
  "ที่ดิน": {
    "Newton": "0-999999",
    "Multiplicity": { "Multiplicity": "0-999" },
    "Ratio": { "Multiplicity": "0-99" }
  }
}
```
