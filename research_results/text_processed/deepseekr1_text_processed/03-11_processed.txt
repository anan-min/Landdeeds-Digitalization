Alright, I need to extract specific values from the given input text based on the provided features and map them accordingly. Let me go through each feature one by one.

First, "ที่ดินระวาง" refers to the place where the road is located. The text mentions "ที่ดิชสติ์ เวลา 66/1", which includes both numbers and letters. I'll take the numerical part since it's within parentheses.

Next, "เลขที่ดิน" is about the numeric information on the road. The number here is 66, so that's straightforward.

Then, " NEC (Newton's Eccentricity)" isn't listed, but from the features, there's "persepsiON" which stands for Newton's eccentricity and it's a text value with an example given. Since it's not listed in the list of features, I'll return a placeholder like "None".

For "เมืองนนทบุรี", the place is "马路", so that's straightforward.

"มาตราส่วน / สเกล" refers to scale or ratio. The text mentions a ratio of 1:500, which fits this feature since it's within parentheses and provides an example.

Moving on to "กิ่ลขั้นการ" is about the road number. The text uses "66/1", so I'll take 66 as the numerical value.

"สุิมีน์" refers to the name of the road, which isn't specified here, so it's a placeholder like "None".

Lastly, "ผู้เขียนแผนที่" is about who wrote the plan. The text mentions "ผู้เขียน", but since it's not listed in features, I'll provide "None".

Now, I'll structure this into JSON as required, making sure each value corresponds correctly and that special values are handled appropriately.
