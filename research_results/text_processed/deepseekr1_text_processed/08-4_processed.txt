Alright, I need to extract the corresponding values from the input text based on the given features. Let's see... The features list has several fields like "ที่ดินระวาง", "เลขที่ดิน", and others with their specific data types.

First, looking at the input text: "# เฟ้นที่". That seems a bit out of place. It ends with a "#" which isn't part of any feature. Maybe it's a placeholder or an error, but I should focus on what's there.

Looking through each feature:

1. **"Tóกิสคริส"**: The text "เต็ม" looks like a typo for "ที่ดิน)(". It should probably be "ที่ดิน".
2. **"เลขที่ดิน"**: The number is in the format "0-999999". The input uses "เต็ม", which fits, and it's numeric.
3. **"T block" (T block)**: The text mentions "เป็นข้อมูล" which likely means it's textual or image-based, but since our features include "ลงชื่อ" as Text or Image, this might be the case.
4. **"เมืองนนทบุรี"**: The text uses "เป็น" which could mean it's a factual statement or information.

I notice that the input is incomplete with "# เ feature". It ends abruptly without providing more details. I'll focus on what I have, even if there are some missing elements.
