Alright, so I need to extract feature values from this Thai land deed document. Let me go through each feature one by one and find their corresponding values.

First, "ที่ดินระวาง" is about the street address format. It's described as ####/## with an example like '1234/56'. Looking at the input text, I don't see any street numbers, so this might be empty or not applicable.

Next, "เลขที่ดิน" refers to the house number, which should be numeric and range from 0-999999. The input text has '1:200' mentioned but no house number here, so maybe it's also empty.

"Toroughb thanu" is the street name with an example of 'บางขุนเทียน'. I don't see any names in the text provided, so this field might be empty too.

"ᵐdro" stands for street code. The format given is ####/##, and again, there's no specific street listed here, so probably empty.

"เชลตชิสที่ดิน" translates to land ownership numeric value, ranging from 0-999. I don't see any numbers here either, so likely empty.

"เลขเล่ม" is the house number code, a numeric range of 0-99. No examples given, but no numbers in the text, so probably empty.

"น้าสำรวจ" refers to the plot size, with a range of 0-100. The input mentions '1.8000' and '1000', which are numeric but perhaps not formatted as specified. Wait, the format is '1:500', so I should check if these match that. '1.8000' might be invalid or mismatched, leading me to consider it empty.

"มีอัตราส่วน" translates to presence of ratio, which could be text or numeric with a range of 1:0-###. The input includes '1:200', so this should be set to '1:200'.

"นิ้merอ Extremely... " refers to land owner name. Since no names are present in the text, I'll leave it empty.

Finally, "ผู้เขียนแผนที่" is about the author of the plan document. The input has 'บริษั Nath планที่บางขุนเทียน', which includes both words and numbers, so I can extract this as a single string value.

I think that's all. Now, I'll structure this into JSON as specified.
