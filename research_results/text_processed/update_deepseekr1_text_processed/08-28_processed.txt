Alright, let me try to figure this out. The user has given a list of features and an input text from a land deed document. They want the corresponding values extracted into a JSON object.

First, I need to parse each feature and map it correctly to the input text. Let's go through them one by one.

1. "ที่ดินระวาง" – That translates to "Plot Number." Looking at the input, I see numbers listed from 1 to 43. So this should be an object with keys like '1', '2', up to '43'.

2. "เลขที่ดิน" – Numeric value for plot number.

3. "ตำบล" – Text representing block names, like "Some roads."

4. "อำเภอ" – Text for city names, e.g., "Newtonbburite."

5. "ฉโนดที่ดิน" – This is the decimal part of the plot number, usually from 0 to 999. In the input text, I don't see any decimals or fractions.

6. "เลขเล่ม" – Numeric range for plot numbers (0-99). So again, matching with the available numbers.

7. "หน้าสำรวจ" – Text indicating front of survey. From the list, it's either 'front' or 'back,' but probably 'front.'

8. "มาตราส่วน / สเกล" – Ratio or scale. The text says 1:500, so we need to parse that.

9. "ลงชื่อ" – Text for map titles or signatures, like "นายสมชาย."

10. "ผู้เขียนแผนที่" – Text for the creator's name or title, here it's "บริษัtha planned roads Newtonbburite."

Now, compiling all this into JSON with keys " plot number" and " scale." The values will be objects containing the respective information.
