Alright, let's tackle this problem step by step. I've got a list of features and an input text that needs to be processed into corresponding values. The task is to extract each feature from the text and map it correctly.

First, I'll read through the features carefully. They all have specific structures—some are alphanumeric codes with formats, others are numeric ranges or specific terms like "text" or "image." The goal is to go through each feature one by one and find matching keywords in the input text.

Looking at the input text: it's a land deed document describing a plan for the province of Thailand. It mentions various sections under "granted land," each with details about boundaries, types of lands, and additional info like color coding between different regions or transportation routes.

Starting with "ที่ดินระวาง" (Land boundary) in Thai. The text refers to places like ".gradientเทพมย์," which translates to "Gratras." I can map this feature as "location: gradientเทพมย์."

Next is "เลขที่ดิน" (Land number). The text mentions numbers like 1234 and 56 in an example format. So, I'll assign this value as a numeric code within the range of 0-999999.

Then there's "ตำบล" (Block number). This is straightforward—it refers to specific blocks listed in the document. The text has entries like "_several block near the city center," so each block will be mapped here with its respective number.

For "อำเภอ" (District name), it mentions places like "เมืองนนทบุรี." Each district is clearly named, so I'll list these names under this feature.

The feature "ฉโนดที่ดิน" (Highest density) uses terms like 1:500. In the input text, I see the ratio mentioned as a key detail, so it should be mapped here with the numeric value of 0-999.

"เล่ม" (Serial number) seems similar to "เลขที่ดิน," but actually refers to a unique identification number, not necessarily a sequential numbering like in some documents. However, since both are related to land numbers, I might consider if they need separate mapping. But looking back at the features list, it's mentioned as numeric ranges and specific terms, so perhaps this is included under "numeric range." Alternatively, maybe it's treated differently. For now, I'll map it under "numeric range: 0-99."

"หน้าสำรวจ" (First section) refers to subdivisions within a land area. The text mentions sections like "ภาคกลาง," which are subdivisions, so this is clear and will be mapped accordingly.

"มาตราส่วน / สเกล" (RATIO or SCALE) uses terms like 1:500, which I've already identified as the highest density. So this should be under ratio or scale with a value of 0-100.

The "ลงชื่อ" (Title/Name) feature is likely names of entities. The text mentions names like "นายสมชาย," so each entity will have its own entry here.

Lastly, "ผู้เขียนแผนที่" (Writer's name) refers to the person who created the plan. The text says "บริsshัติ планที่ certain blocks." So I'll map this feature with their names.

After mapping all features, I'll structure them into a JSON object as specified, ensuring each key and value are correctly assigned based on the input text.

  "ที่ดินระวาง": "Gradientเทพมย์",
  "เลขที่ดิน": "1234/56",
  "ตำบล": "_several block near the city center",
  "อำเภอ": "เมืองนนทบุรี",
  "ฉโนติ Dave: 0-999",
  "เล่ม": "0-99",
  "หน้าสำรวจ": "ภาคกลาง",
  "มาตราส่วน / สเกล": "1:500",
  "ลงชื่อ": "นายสมชาย",
  "ผู้เขียนแผนที่": "บริsshัติ планที่ certain blocks."
}
