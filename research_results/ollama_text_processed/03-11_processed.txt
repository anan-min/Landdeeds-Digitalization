Alright, let me try to figure out how to extract the required values from this input text based on the given features. The input is a bit short, just mentioning "ที่ดินระหว่าง เลข 66/1", followed by some specific details like BEDOards, BOYS, JUNGHO, JUGHDANG, and then numbers like 45 and other details.

First, I need to understand each feature. The features list includes things like "ที่ดินระวาง" which is alphanumeric code with a specific format and example, "เลขที่ดิน" as numeric with a range, "ตำบล", which is text with examples, and so on until "ผู้เขียนแผนที่".

Now, looking at the input: ที่ดินระหว่าง เลข 66/1. So I see that there's a Thai phrase here that starts with "ที่ดิน" followed by "ระหว่าง" which I think means between in some contexts, but maybe it's just part of the text.

Next, BEDOards is mentioned: BEDOards = " Bedoards ", and BOYS is "Boys ". Then JUNGHO is "Jungho". JUGHDANG is "Jungdang".

Now, looking at the numbers given: 45. But I need to see if this corresponds to any of the numeric features. Let's go through each feature in order:

1. Thai code: No '45' here.
2. Numeric ranges:
   - 0-999999 for leeway numbers
   - 0-999 for cheement
   - 0-100 for nage
3. Ratio or scale: None mentioned.
4. Text or Image: No text in the input yet.
5. Numeric value:
   - Leeway number is up to 999,999, but we have 66/1 here.
   - 66/1 is within leeway numbers (0-999999).
6. Numerical details:
   - Cheement: 66
   - Jum: 6
7. Unit information:
   - Bedoards: Jum, Jang
8. Image or text info:
   - The text is "45" without any image.
9. Scale description:

Wait, the input here has "66/1", which might not directly map to the scale feature because it's a ratio. So maybe it's just part of leeway numbers.

So I think for the numeric features, 66/1 is within leeway (0-999999). Then, the text info includes Jum and Jang since "Jum" is present in the BEDOards, BOYS, etc. The scale might not apply here.

Putting it all together, I'll extract each feature as per their description from the input.

{
  "ที่ดินระวาง": "45",
  " numerical details: leeway number (0-999999)",
  "text information: Jum, Jang",
  "scale description": "1:###"
}
