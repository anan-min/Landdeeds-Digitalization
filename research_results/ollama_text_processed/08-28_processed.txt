Alright, let me try to figure out how to extract the corresponding values from this input text and turn it into a JSON structure. So, first, I see that there are several features provided in a list, each with their own value and explanation. The goal is to match these features to the information given in the input text.

Let's start by going through each feature one by one.

1. **ที่ดินระวาง**: This translates to "location of streets." In the input text, I see a table labeled "หน้า" (front), and under it, there are lines that look like they might be indicating some kind of numbering or identification for each front row. But I'm not exactly sure how this maps to the features provided. The feature "ที่ดินระวาง" is supposed to have an example format: '1234/56', so maybe each front row represents a street with numbers, but I don't see any numbers in the input text. So, I might assume that there's no matching value for this feature here.

2. **เลขที่ดิน**: This means "digits on streets," which refers to numeric values representing streets. The input text has a table where each row has two cells with checkmarks and numbers. It seems like these are numerical values (like 1, 2, etc.) that might correspond to the street numbers. However, since I don't see any actual digits in the data provided, this feature probably doesn't have a corresponding value either.

3. **ตำบล**: This stands for "block number" or "address block." In the input text, there's a list of numerical values with checkmarks in some rows and an 'O' indicating whether they're correct. For example:
   ```
   1 ✓
   2 ✓
   3 ✓
   ...
   40 ✓
   41 ✓
   42 ✓
   43 ✓
   44 ✓
   45 ✓
   46 ✓
   47 ✓
   48 ✓
   49 ✓
   50 ✓
   51 ✓
   52 ✓
   ...
   50 ✓
   51 ✓
   52 ✓
   ```
   This seems like the numbers are in a list where each number is correct, so I can assign values from 1 to 52. But wait, the features only go up to "เป็นตัวอย่าง...(####/##)" which is numeric with range 0-999999 and also "Numerics, Range: 0-999" for "เลขเล่ม." This suggests that numbers can be up to four digits. So in the input text, the first few lines have numbers like '1', '2', etc., but I don't see any higher numbers listed as correct except in rows where it's marked with a checkmark.

   Hmm, maybe all the entries are correctly numbered? But looking at row 49: "49 ✓" and row 50: "50 ✓", so yes, they're all from 1 to 52. So for each entry that is checked, I can map it to a numeric value.

4. **อำเภอ**: This translates to "city name," which would be text labels indicating the city. In the input text, under the "%Eเมืองนนทบุรี" column, there are various names listed: " MagicMockนทบุรี...". There are multiple entries like " MagicMockลิขสิทธิ์ที่มีอัตราส่วน 1:500", which seems to be a specific city. Then there's " MagicMockลิขสิทธิ์ที่มีอัตราส่วน 1:250", and so on, down to " Magic Hill (อาจหมายถึงบุรีหรือเมือง?)". Some of these seem like names or locations, while others are in Thai and might be city names.

   Since the input text only has textual entries for some rows, I need to determine which ones correspond to cities. Given that some names like "Magic Hill" sound like places, but not all are definite city names. For example, " MagicMockลิขสิทธิ์ที่มีอัตราส่วน 1:250" might be a specific area, possibly a town or village. Others could still refer to cities. This is tricky because I don't have an exhaustive list of all city names in the input text.

   Therefore, it's impossible to map each feature without additional information about which entries are city names. So, perhaps only those entries that are explicitly labeled as cities can be mapped. For example, if "Magic Hill (อาจหมายถึงบุรีหรือเมือง?)" is a specific location mentioned in the text, maybe it's considered a city name here.

5. **MELE wax**: This translates to "melting point," which would be numeric values indicating temperatures or degrees. In the input text, under the "%Eว Wax" column, I see some checkmarks and numbers:
   ```
   49 ✓
   47 ✓
   ...
   25 ✓
   23 ✓
   21 ✓
   19 ✓
   17 ✓
   15 ✓
   13 ✓
   11 ✓
   9 ✓
   7 ✓
   5 ✓
   3 ✓
   1 ✓
   ```
   This seems like descending odd numbers from 49 down to 1, so the melting points are 1, 3, ..., 49. But I need to map these specific values.

6. **MELE temperature**: This translates to "melting temperature," which is numeric with a range of 0-999. From the input text, all entries that have checkmarks under this feature seem to be in odd numbers from 1 up, so their melting temperatures are likely within this range. However, without specific values, I can't assign exact degrees.

7. **หน้าสำรวจ**: This stands for "front" or "section," which refers to text labels indicating geographical sections. In the input text, under "%Eเมืองนนทบุรี", each row is either a checkmark (O) indicating it's correct or an 'X' marking incorrect. For example:
   ```
   1 ✓
   2 ✓
   ...
   47 ✓
   48 ✓
   49 ✓
   50 ✓
   51 ✓
   52 ✓
   53 ✓
   ...
   60 ✓
   ```
   This suggests that each row represents a section, but since it's numbered from 1 to 60, each "_section" is correctly mapped. However, without an explicit list of what each section is, I can't assign specific values here.

8. **มาตราส่วน / สเกล**: This translates to "ratio or scale," which could be text or numeric ratios. In the input text, only one row has a number like "1:500" in bold. The rest are either checkmarks (O) indicating correctness or checkmark for incorrectness. So, I think this feature is about mapping values based on ratios. For example, if the ratio is 1:500, it might mean scale in maps. But without specific values, I can only assign a default value or note that it's text or numeric as needed.

9. **ลงชื่อ**: This stands for "label" or "annotation," which refers to images or text indicating something on the map. In the input text, under the "%Eเมืองนนทบุรี" column, I see entries like:
   ```
   Magic Hill (อาจหมายถึงบุรีหรือเมือง?)
   Magic Hill 09
   ...
   Magic Hill (อาจหมายถึงบุรีหรือเมือง?)
   ```
   These seem to be names or addresses. For example, "Magic Hill 09" might indicate a specific location, and some entries are in Thai or use Chinese characters. I need to determine which of these are city names, towns, or other locations.

10. **ผู้เขียนแผนที่**: This is "author," who provides the map. In the input text, under "%Eว Wax" (melting point), there's an entry with a number in bold:
    ```
    49 ✓
    ```
    Additionally, some entries like " Magic Hill (อาจหมายถึงบุรีหรือเมือง?)" have numbers under "%Eว Wax" and checkmarks. I don't see any specific author name here, so maybe this feature doesn't need a value or the author's name.

11. **สารบัญจดทะเบียน**: This translates to "index logbook," which refers to data logs associated with the map. The input text includes mentions of various logbooks and references to specific creators like Phra Ya (or perhaps a title). Without explicit values, I can't extract any numerical or categorical data for this feature.

Putting it all together, here's how I would structure the JSON:

- Each feature from the list is mapped to its corresponding entry in the input text. The features that have numeric values with checkmarks are mapped to "MELE temperature," and those with strings (like names) are mapped to "%Eเมืองนนทบุรี."

However, since I can't map all the text-based entries without specific values, some of these may remain as text or notes. For example:
- **%Eว Wax** has numeric values from 1 to 49 in checkmarks.
- **%Eเมืองนนทบุรี** includes both numbered and named sections, with most being names.
- The feature "%Eว wax" is about mapping ratios, but without specific values, it's text or needs more context.

Finally, the JSON structure would include:
- A list of features (from the original list)
- Each feature mapped to its corresponding value in the input text
- The JSON is enclosed within square brackets and uses commas to separate entries

I think I have a rough idea now. I'll start by mapping each feature step by step, using both the values and descriptions from the input text.
